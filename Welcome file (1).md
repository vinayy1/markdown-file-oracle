## What Did I Do?
 First I installed docker software on the computer,after being installed I found 1 aur 2 errors .So I tried troubleshooting them by updating with the help of WSL(WINDOWS SUBSYSTEM for LINUX).
After that we restarted our computer and then started the docker software which in turn removed the errors and the docker software started running successfully.
After that I downloaded the GitHub repositories which were mentioned by you in the documentation.
Then we unzipped the GitHub repositories and while using the command prompt I made a container image inside the Docker software.Then ,while running the container image I ran it on Local host :3000 .
Finally ,I was able to run all the applications on docker while doing operation on Local Host :3000
## Issues Faced
While working on this project, I encountered a few issues. One of the main issues I faced was understanding how to use the docker run command to properly start the app in the container. But with the help of online resources and the Docker documentation, I was able to successfully run the app in the container.
## Docker As A Tool
Docker is a powerful tool for deploying and maintaining applications.  I found that Docker containers make it easy to deploy and run applications in different environments. I would approach a procedure like this by first familiarizing myself with the Docker documentation and searching for additional resources if I encountered any issues.


## Various Purposes
                                                                                                                                      
To Approach This type of procedure for maintenance and deployment of applications requires that proceed with the official documentation and follow all the steps and instructions provided or mentioned for that particular procedure for deploying and maintaining applications like this , if any features or steps are missing, they can be found on websites like Stack Overflow, Guru, Bloomfire, etc.
Docker containers can be used to deploy multiple instances of an application, allowing for easy scaling. Containers can be used to deploy applications on a cloud platform like AWS, Google Cloud, or Azure. Docker can be used to deploy microservices-based applications, which are composed of multiple, small, loosely-coupled services.
## Experience
Overall, it was a great experience to work on this project and I look forward to experimenting more with Docker in the future.
Thanks For Giving Me this Opportunity.
